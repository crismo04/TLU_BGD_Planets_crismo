## Work: Regular + challenge:

- Create 3 Planets, one of them with eliptical orbit around the sun, and other with multiple layers.

- Add two moons to the bigger planet and make them rotate arround it.
- Make audio rotate arround the sun in 3D form to shifts between the right and left speakers.
- Make everything rotate around themselve (i didn't need another script, I did it rotating arround themselves)
